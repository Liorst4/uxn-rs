Implementation of the UXN virtual machine in the Rust programming language.

This project is still work in progress, the current implementation supports
all the devices except for audio.

Project goals:
To have fun.
To implement a varvara environment.
To have a somewhat small binary footprint (minimize the amount of dependencies).
Support multiple operating systems.

Non goals:
To replace the classic C implementation.
To be 100% free of "unsafe" code
To be the fastest implementation
